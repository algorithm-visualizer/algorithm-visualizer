# Stable Matching
In mathematics, economics, and computer science, the stable marriage problem (also stable matching problem or SMP) is the problem of finding a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for each element. A matching is a mapping from the elements of one set to the elements of the other set. A matching is not stable if: There is an element A of the first matched set which prefers some given element B of the second matched set over the element to which A is already matched, and also prefers A over the element to which B is already matched. In other words, a matching is stable when there does not exist any match (A, B) by which both A and B would be individually better off than they are with the element to which they are currently matched.
