# K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a method to partition _n_ observations into _k_ clusters in which each observation belongs to 
the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid).

Given a set of observations, where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, _k-means_ clustering aims to 
partition the _n_ observations into _k(â‰¤ n)_ sets so as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (i.e. variance).

## Complexity
* **Time**: ![$O(n^{2k+1})$](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(n^{2k+1})) for 2-dimensional real vector
