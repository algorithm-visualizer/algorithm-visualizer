# Affine Cipher
The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, wherein each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.

## Applications
* Cryptanalysis
* More complex Variations of Affine Cipher are used in practical cryptography

## Complexity
* **Time**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(N)), ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?N) = length of plain/cipher text
* **Space**: worst ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?O(N)), to create the new mapping (plain->cipher, cipher->plain)
