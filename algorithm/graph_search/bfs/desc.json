  "BFS": "Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.",
  "Applications": [
    "Copying garbage collection, Cheney's algorithm",
    "Finding the shortest path between two nodes u and v, with path length measured by number of edges (an advantage over depth-first search)",
    "Testing a graph for bipartiteness",
    "(Reverse) Cuthill–McKee mesh numbering",
    "Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network",
    "Serialization/Deserialization of a binary tree vs serialization in sorted order, allows the tree to be re-constructed in an efficient manner.",
    "Construction of the failure function of the Aho-Corasick pattern matcher."
