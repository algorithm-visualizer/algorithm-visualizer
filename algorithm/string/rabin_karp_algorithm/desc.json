  "Rabin–Karp Algorithm": "Rabin–Karp algorithm or Karp–Rabin algorithm is a string searching algorithm created by Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin (1987) that uses hashing to find any one of a set of pattern strings in a text.",
  "Applications": [
    "Substring Search"
  ],
  "Complexity": {
    "time": " $O(N)$ : If a sufficiently large prime number is used for the hash function. $O(M\\cdot N)$ : Worst Case ",
    "space": "$O( 1 )$"
