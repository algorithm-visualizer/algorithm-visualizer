Learning algorithms from text and static images is quite boring. There have been many great websites that view animations of various algorithms though, for us being coders, nothing can be more comprehensible than visualizing the actual working code.

## Contributing

**I want to add or improve an algorithm.**

- We have a separate repository for public algorithms. Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in [`algorithms`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) repo.

**I want to improve the UI.**

- Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo. The [directory structure](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md#algorithm-visualizer) might be helpful as well.

**I want to enhance visualization libraries.**

- It is highly recommended to read the entire [project details](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md) before working on it. Making changes to visualization libraries often requires a lot of work since you may need to work on all of the following repositories: [`algorithms`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms), [`tracers`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers), and [`algorithm-visualizer`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer). We encourage you to raise an issue about your idea of enhancement before working on it.

**I have a question in regards to contributing.**

- Raising an issue is another way of contributing!
