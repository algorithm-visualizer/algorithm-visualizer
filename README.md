Learning algorithms from text and static images is quite boring. There have been many great websites that view animations of various algorithms though, for us being coders, nothing can be more comprehensible than visualizing the actual working code.

## Contributing

If you want to ...

- **Add or improve an algorithm.**

  We have a separate repository for public algorithms. Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in [`algorithms`](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) repo.

- **Improve the UI.**

  Check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in this repo. The [directory structure](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md#algorithm-visualizer) might be helpful as well.

- **Revise the specifications of visualization libraries.**
  
  Making changes to the specifications is often followed by updating visualization libraries for every supported language and the affected public algorithms accordingly. It is highly recommended to read the entire [project details](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer/blob/master/PROJECT_DETAILS.md) and to raise an issue about your proposal before working on it.

- **Fix issues in a visualization library for a specific langauge.**

  Check out the contributing guidelines ([JavaScript](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [C++](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers.cpp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Java](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/tracers.java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)) in the repo of the visualization library.
