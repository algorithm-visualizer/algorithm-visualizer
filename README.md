## Contributing

We have multiple repositories under the hood that comprise the website. Take a look at the contributing guidelines in the repository you want to contribute to.

- [**`algorithm-visualizer`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer) is a web app written in React. It contains UI components and interprets commands into visualizations. Check out [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [**`server`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/server) serves the web app and provides APIs that it needs on the fly. (e.g., GitHub sign in, compiling/running code, etc.)

- [**`algorithms`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) contains visualizations of algorithms shown on the side menu of the website.

- [**`tracers.*`**](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Avisualization-library+org%3Aalgorithm-visualizer&type=Repositories) are visualization libraries written in each supported language. They extract visualizing commands from code.
